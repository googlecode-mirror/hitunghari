# Installing #

Installation is very straight forward.

  1. Copy all files to your webserver directory.
  1. Rename 'mosc-countdown-img.php' to any name you like
  1. Change the images in 'countbg-images' to your event images.
> > _please note that countdown number color is always yellow and I didn't make the number position be flexible and available in config file yet. You can change this by modifying the 'mosc-countdown-img.php'_
  1. Set the date of your event to countdown in hh-config.php
  1. you are set and ready to go

Enjoy!
